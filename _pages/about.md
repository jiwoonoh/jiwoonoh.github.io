  <p>Welcome!</p>

  <p>I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/natalia-trayanova/" target="_blank">Natalia Trayanova</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://ai.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Data Science and AI Institute (DSAI)</a>. My research focuses on building AI models using multimodal clinical data for diagnosis and prognostics of cardiovascular diseases, as well as investigating downstream machine learning methodologies to ensure the models' reliability.</p>

  <p> I completed my BS in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University in May 2025. </p>
  
  <p> Always happy to chat :) </p>
