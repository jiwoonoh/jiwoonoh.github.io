I am an undergraduate senior at Johns Hopkins University, studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer science. 
My focus area is computational medicine, and I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant advised by [Natalia Trayanova](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/natalia-trayanova/). My research interest lies in precision medicine, predictive modeling, multimodal AI, and deep phenotyping algorithms. I am very interested in building predictive models using multimodal data (e.g. EHR, imaging, waveform, etc.) for diagnosis and prognostics of various diseases for individual patients. 
 
In [Trayanova Lab](https://www.trayanovalab.org/), I am working with a deep learning model to predict patient-specific electrophysiology to improve arrhythmia prognostics. I am also fortunate to have worked with various faculty ([Casey Overby Taylor](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/casey-overby-taylor/), [Joseph Greenstein](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/joseph-greenstein/), [James Fackler](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/james-jim-fackler/)) and industry advisors (from [Nihon Kohden America](https://us.nihonkohden.com/)) to develop a predictive model for the cardiac arrest risk. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in multimodal learning and medical data analysis.

I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea until I was 12. I lived in Shanghai, China until high school graduation and moved to Baltimore, MD for college. My diverse background growing up allowed me to be bilingual in English and Korean with full proficiency in Mandarin and limited proficiency in French. 

When I am not doing academic work, I love to cook diverse cuisines and bake simple desserts. I also enjoy hosting dinners for friends :)
